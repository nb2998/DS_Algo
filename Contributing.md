<h3>Important guidelines</h3>

- The repository consists of a variety of data structures and algorithms. 
- Feel free to add new ones if they don't exist already in a language. 
- If the same code exists in another language, add the code in your preferred language to the same package/folder.
- It is a good practise to work on branches. It will enable you to make multiple pull requests without waiting for one to get merged.
- Please use camel case (thisIsCamelCase) to name files and variables.
- Avoid submitting multiple algorithms in a single pull request.
