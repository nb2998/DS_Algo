// You are playing EVE Online. Initially, you have one dollar, but you have somehow acquired two cheat codes.
//The first cheat code multiplies the amount of money you own by 10, while the second one multiplies it by 20. 
//The cheat codes can be used any number of times.You want to have exactly N dollars.
//Now you are wondering: can you achieve that by only using some sequence of cheat codes?
